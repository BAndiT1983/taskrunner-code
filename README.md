# Task Runner

There are many tools that exist to automate parts of your project, including for installing dependencies, building, testing, linting, deploying. This extension adds an additional "Task Runner" view in your Explorer Pane to visualize and individually run the auto-detected tasks in your project. VS Code auto-detects the following task runners: Gulp, Grunt, Jake and npm.
